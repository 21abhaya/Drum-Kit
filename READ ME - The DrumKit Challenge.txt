Most HTML and CSS was pre-written. The objective was to learn DOM manipulation using JavaScript, and understand the use of event listeners, how to add event listeners, handler functions, callback functions, objects, methods and switch cases while also incorporating my learnings from previous lessons. Manipulating styling using JS to add animations as part of the interaction. The outcome was an interactive website that plays different sounds of a drum kit with animations at the press of buttons or keys.
